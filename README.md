brokit
======

The Biological Research (application controller) Obsolescence Kit (brokit - canonically pronounced 'brah-kit') package contains the application controllers for command line bioinformatics applications.

**Note:** brokit is currently under active development and its API is not stable. Major compatibility-breaking API changes will likely happen as development progresses.
